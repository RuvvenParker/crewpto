# Crewpto
FinTech Summit Hackathon 
Crewpto is a blockchain-based platform designed to simplify group expense management by integrating Metamask, a smart contract, and the XRPL EVM Sidechain Testnet. The solution addresses the inefficiencies of existing platforms by combining expense tracking with seamless settlement, all within a decentralized ecosystem.
We ensure that group expenses are recorded transparently on the blockchain, with all transactions verifiable via a blockchain explorer. By combining user-friendliness with the security and efficiency of blockchain technology, we redefined shared expense management, offering a modern, cross-border solution for groups worldwide.
